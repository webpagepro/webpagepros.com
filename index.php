        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


        <p>Enjoy working with Open Source E-commerce platforms such as Magento, as well as, custom built e-business software hosted on Apache server, and built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. Essentially, I am fascinated with computers and how they can be used to improve the optimal efficiency of business processes through automation and enhancing the user experience.
.</p>
        <p>For design purposes, I have been using the Adobe Creative Suite since it was first owned by Macromedia. Which includes programs, such as: Flash, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Illustrator, and Photoshop. Also familiar with rendering audio/video files, ie: H.264, MPEG-4, Real Audio/Video, Windows Media, Apple Quicktime, Shockwave, Flash, Director, Flac, and Ogg, which are often used in the production of effective e-learning and advertising content optimal for online streaming performance. Including the initial process of capturing media from the recording device using software, such as: Adobe Premier, Adobe After Effects, and Fmpeg. 
</p>
<p>Most recently, I have been supporting the technical needs for Evan Hayes, a local property manager, in optimizing the business processes for his personal office. In addition, I am performing the roles of both technical consultant and web developer for Evan's new start-up business, Evan N' More.

Therefore, in addition to web design related projects, I have also performed various Windows OS based system installations, repairs, and upgrades. Ranging from laptop and desktop hardware repairs to software configuration, virus removal, and system recovery.</p>

            <h2>FLEXBOX CONTINUED</h2>

<p> Flexbox allows you to lay out elements in a container, arrange and (re)order them, align them, and distribute the space between (and/or around) them, regardless of their size. It allows you to make them literally flexible—items inside a container can be stretched and shrunk to accommodate the available space, and can be sized in proportionally to each other, and any available space between or around them can be distributed among them based on a proportion that you get to specify.</p>

        <p>Flexbox allows for the creation of more adaptive and responsive layouts that adapt to the layout changes on different screen sizes and orientations.</p>
        <p> Last but not least, you can change the visual order of elements inside the container without affecting their actual order in the markup. This means that you can change the order in which certain items appear on the page, while preserving their order in the markup. This is useful for when you want to highlight certain items, such as a featured blog post, even if those items don’t come first in the markup.</p>
