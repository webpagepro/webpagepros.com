				<h2>SEO Friendly JQuery Slider</h2>

					<p>The following URL points to a JQuery slider that I was asked to create during my time at Petsmart.   You can notice the textual markup exists separate from the image
						by simply dragging the mouse cursor over the letters while hlding the left mouse button down, as you would normally do to highlight a word or phrase just before copying it. The purpose was again for making the page  more search engine friendly.  At the time, it was a pretty big feat!</p>

		     <h2>PSD to Web</h2>
                <p>Michaels Wilder Agency, a long-standing Phoenix marketing agency, asked me to assist them during a major re-branding period for the organization.  My role was to take an image file created by the company's creative department and emulate it's appearance and functionality for the web.  A process commonly referred to as, PSD to Web. Moreover, the IT Director wanted it to be done without using Javascript.  In other words, he wanted done with pure HTML and CSS.  His reasoning stemmed from a concern with Javascript and the various ways it can prevent users from viewing the page as it was intended.  In addittion, Javascript can often times be ignored by search engine robots.
				</p>
					  <p>At the time, I had never seen anything like this done before and could not find any resources to guide me throug the process.  Hence, it was a task that proved to be a challenge.  One which, in retrospect, I am proud to have met. Click the following link to view the results by rolling the mouse over the menu items located on the top right area of the page:</p>
