        <h2>FLEXBOX LAYOUT</h2>


        <p>This website was built using the latest CSS3 layout schema approved by the W3C earlier this year, called Flexbox. In other words, this page layout you are now viewing was achieved without floats to position to position objects, accordingly. In CSS 2.1, four layout modes were defined which determine the size and position of boxes based on their relationships with their sibling and ancestor boxes: the block layout designed for laying out documents, and that lays elements on a page vertically; the inline layout designed for laying out text horizontally inside block-level containers; the table layout designed for laying out two-dimensional data in a tabular format; and the positioned layout designed for very explicit positioning without much regard for other elements in the document.</p>
        <p> Flexbox is similar to the block layout, except that it lacks many of the properties that can be used in a block layout, such as floats and columns. But then again it has more flexibility for distributing space and aligning content in ways that web applications and complex web pages often need. It solves many other layout problems that we have been fighting against and trying to solve for a very long time—such as vertical centering, for example, among many others.</p>
        <p> Flexbox allows you to lay out elements in a container, arrange and (re)order them, align them, and distribute the space between (and/or around) them, regardless of their size. It allows you to make them literally flexible—items inside a container can be stretched and shrunk to accommodate the available space, and can be sized in proportionally to each other, and any available space between or around them can be distributed among them based on a proportion that you get to specify.</p>

            <h2>FLEXBOX CONTINUED</h2>



        <p>Flexbox allows for the creation of more adaptive and responsive layouts that adapt to the layout changes on different screen sizes and orientations.</p>
        <p> Last but not least, you can change the visual order of elements inside the container without affecting their actual order in the markup. This means that you can change the order in which certain items appear on the page, while preserving their order in the markup. This is useful for when you want to highlight certain items, such as a featured blog post, even if those items don’t come first in the markup.</p>
